This is an application that is meant to show the amount of time left until
graduation in obscure measurements, such as hot dogs eaten or games bought on
steam.

// Instructions for getting the app running

In order to run the test suite, simply go to the graduation_countdown directory
in command line with RUBY or something similar, and run the command rspec.
