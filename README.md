# The Amazing Graduation Timer

This is an application that is meant to show the amount of time left until
graduation in obscure measurements, such as hot dogs eaten or games bought on
steam.

How to get the application running:
1. Follow the steps to install ruby here: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/ 
2. Install rails using the command "gem install rails"
3. Download the zip using the github "Clone or download" button and then extract it
4. Navigate to the root of extracted file
5. Install dependencies using the command "bundle install"
6. Use the command "rails server"
7. You're done!

In order to run the test suite, simply go to the graduation_countdown directory
in command line with RUBY or something similar, and run the command rspec.
